The map xi on O_3/S_3(4) to O_3/S_3(5)
==============================
The images are in the codomain
The map xi is injective.
The detailed map is...

    
    Partition [[3, 1], [], []] 
    (in TD_{3, 1})
    maps to 
    [[3], [1], [1]]
    (in TD_{3, 2})
                      

    
    Partition [[1], [3], []] 
    (in TD_{6, 1})
    maps to 
    [[], [3, 1], [1]]
    (in TD_{6, 2})
